    <article>Montenegro is a country located in the west-central Balkans<br> 
        at the southern end of the Dinaric Alps. <br> 
        It is bounded by the Adriatic Sea and Croatia to the southwest,<br>  
        Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast,<br>  
        Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the southeast.</article>
    <p>The Bay of Kotor is the largest Adriatic bay between Montenegro and Croatia.<br> 
        The Bay of Kotor is sometimes called Europeâ€™s southernmost fjord,<br> 
        but it is not exactly correct: according to the latest studies the bay is,<br> 
        in fact, an inlet formed by a partial submergence of a river valley.</p>
    <p>Gabela street is located in the town of Risan on the Bay of Kotor.<br>
       It dates from the 12th century and is constructed from river rocks.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The walls and structures in the Bay of Kotor are built from rocks<br> 
        mined in local quaries.<br>
        Many walls are centuries old and still stand today<br>
